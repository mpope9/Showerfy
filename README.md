# Showerfy
Showerfy v0.0.2 - A VST/AU to simulate my shower.

This is a Impulse Response plugin written for my senior project at CSU Chico.  It makes what is recorded sound like it was made in my shower.  Tested on REAPER, working reasonably well.  

## Installation Instructions
comming soon....

## Features
1) A wet/dry control knob to choose how much convlution is allowed.
2) A Pre-Delay knob, with the option of locking the channels.  If channels are unlocked a funky effect happens.  
3) A Shower sound knob, used to mix in me showering.

This is written in C++ using the JUCE framework.
